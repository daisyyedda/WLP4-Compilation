# WLP4-to-MIPS-Compiler
A simulation of the WLP4 (a simplified version of C++) compilation process, which includes the followings: <br/>
A compiler that translates WLP4 programs into MIPS Assembly Language. <br/>
An assembler that translates MIPS Assembly Language to MERL (MIPS Executable Relocatable Linkable) object code. <br/>
A linker/loader that links the MERL object files, any needed library code, and a small runtime file to form an executable program. <br/>
