# WLP4-to-MIPS-Compiler
A simulation of the WLP4 (a simplified version of C++) compilation process, which includes: 
A compiler that translates WLP4 programs into MIPS Assembly Language.
An assembler that translates MIPS Assembly Language to MIPS Machine Language.
A linker/loader that links all the object files, any needed library code, and a small runtime file to form an executable program.
